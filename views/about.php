			<h4>Who we are and what we're trying to do.</h4>

			<p>Our mission is simple - provide a service that can be used by the Super Smash Bros. community at all levels. We want to provide every region and scene with the tools to promote hype for their players, help keep track of player performance, and get people involved.</p>

			<h4>Promote your players.</h4>

			<p>Our <a href='/page/players/10/' target='_blank'>player profile pages</a> give players the opportunity to provide some context about themselves. Let us know who you play in each game. Talk about your play style and brag about tourney victories. Show us some sets you've played.</p>

			<p>Aside from building up individual players, the profile pages can give commentators a great point of reference to use when talking about a player they may not be very familiar with.</p>

			<h4>Track your players.</h4>

			<p>Maybe your scene already has a longstanding PR list, or perhaps you never got around to putting a ranking system together. No matter the state of your scene's ranking, we think we can lend a hand. Our player ranking uses a modified <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system' target='_blank'>Elo rating system</a> to help put a number to player performance.</p>

			<p>We made sure to keep this part easy for TOs. With full Challonge support, you can upload bracket data and let us take care of the rest. SmashTracker will store match data wherever we can, with the ability to compare head-to-head results between players, performance over time, and individual win records.

			<h4>Involve your community.</h4>

			<p>Competitive Super Smash Bros. is nothing without its community, but we know it can be difficult sometimes to get the players to care about some things as much as TOs do. It's always easier to get the community involved when they can see the results of their actions.</p>

			<p>Power Rankings have traditionally been an excellent way to increase a region's overall competitive atmosphere. <a href='/page/regions/1/' target='_blank'>Giving players a score</a> and a way to climb up in ranks encourages participation in local events, expanding knowledge of the game's mechanics and strategy, and pushes the community as a whole to perform on a higher level.</p>

			<h4>We'd like to hear from you.</h4>

			<p>Just as Smash Bros. is nothing without it's community, SmashTracker can't be at its best alone. We invite you to contact us on <a href='https://twitter.com/ssbtracker' target='_blank'>Twitter</a> or <a href='https://www.facebook.com/smashtracker' target='_blank'>Facebook</a> if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions.</p>

			<p>Thanks for being here!</p>
			<p> - The SmashTracker Team</p>
